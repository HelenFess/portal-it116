       <p>Hello, my name is Helen Fessahaie, and I'm part of the Year Up program, which has been a phenomenal experience for me. </p>
       
       <p>I was previously working in corporate America in the sales department, which I truly loved.
         Apart from when Covid-19 hit, all our jobs we're not secured anymore.

      <p>I saw my team losing their livelihood. I saw many of my peers being laid off, which did not resonate well with me.
         I've decided to research learning how to transition, and I realized I could join Year up to support me moving into a different career path.</p>

       <p> My dream job is to work as a software engineer and really be great at it it's just something that I've been interested in for a while and being able to apply these skills in my class on with my classmates has really shown me how it is rewarding task.
           I'm very excited to apply there's my internship and I'm looking forward to working with you and your team. </p>
           
         I would love to see if you have time to be my mentor.
        
        </p>
